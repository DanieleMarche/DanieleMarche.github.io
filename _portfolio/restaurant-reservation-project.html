<p>
  The technologies used were Flutter and Firebase. The application actually sends the data of the
  reservation on the FireStore database. This project was left unfinished due to a change of focus on an
  project and to doubts on the possible financial returns as this was intended as a service to sell to restaurants.
</p>

<p>
  This project was intended as a multiplatform application. 
  This is the reason why it was decided to use Dart and the framework Flutter, because it eanbles multiplatform with one code. 
  The UI was created usign the MaterialUI library and the date picker was created by Vivek Ausik and modified by me for the specified uses inside the application.
  The application uses a Firestore databases where the reservations are stored. The database is non-relational with a single document. 
  At this stage the reservations are sent to the database, but the UI and UX are still to improve.

  Below are left some picturef of the project and the database.
