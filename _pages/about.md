    <p>Hi there, this is my personal website related to my work in CS. My name is Daniele. I'm an Italian student.</p>
    <p>I currently study Computer Science at Sapienza University of Rome. This is my second year of my Bachelor's Degree.
    On my free time, I like to experiment and try new languages and frameworks that are not taught at school. </p>

    <p>Actually, I did not start to study CS classes at my Uni; my high school was an Italian "Information Technology Technical Institute," which is basically a high school with CS classes. During my high school years, I took classes in Java, Databases, and Computer Networks. I liked these subjects and decided to keep studying CS. </p>
