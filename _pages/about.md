Hi there, this is my personal webiste related on my work in CS. My name is Daniele. I'm an italian student. I currently study Computer Science at Sapienzaa University of Rome. This is my second year of my Bachelor's Degree.
On my free time i like to experiment and try new languages and framework that are not teached at school. 

Actually i did not start to study CS classes at my Uni, my high school was an italian "Information Technology Technical Institute", which is basically a high school whith CS classes. During my high school years i took classes of Java, Database and  Computer Networks. I liked these subjects and decided to keep studying CS.
