    <p>Hi there, this is my personal website related to my work in CS. My name is Daniele. I'm an Italian student.</p>
    <p>I currently study Computer Science at Sapienza University of Rome. This is my second year of my Bachelor's Degree.</p>
    <p>On my free time, I like to experiment and try new languages and frameworks that are not taught at school. </p>

    <p>I started studying CS in my high school years. I went to an Italian "Information Technology Technical Institute", which is basically a high school with CS classes. During my high school years, I took classes in Java, Databases, and Computer Networks. I liked these subjects and decided to keep studying CS. </p>
